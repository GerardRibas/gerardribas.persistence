Gerard Ribas Persistence
=================

This is the readme file for gerardribas.persistence project.

In this project you will see the simplicity of Spring ORM with Java Persistence API.

What is in this package
=======================

You have only 2 packages:

	--src
		--es.gerardribas.persistence.dao
		--es.gerardribas.persistence.dao.impl
		
	--test
	
You will see only 3 important files in this package:

	- AbstractDao <- Basic interface of any dao implementation.
	- AbstractJpaDao <- Basic interface of any JPA Dao.
	-AbstractJpaDaoImpl <- Abstract class for all general methods on Jpa Dao.

This run's? Let's try it!
=========================

Please check the packages of test. You will see a sample of one dao (CustomerDao and CustomerDaoImpl) and one entity Customer. 

For test that it runs, you can execute CustomerDaoTestCase. This test have an embedded database (HSQLDB) for testing all methods of AbstractJPADao. 

I hope my code helps you! 

Thanks for watching
